- make it so that you can't escape the lanes (put in walls)

x game over screen
x recharge within your towers radius
x balance the towers to be beatable (should spend longer burning down the creeps, prioritize targets based on distance)
x add abilities to the players
x have an xp counter for the players
x take attack off of home base
x can't heal home base
x random number of creeps spawned
x attacking should be prioritized on distance
x make the win state actually calculate correctly
x should only heal creeps that actually need it
x creeps attack dead player (should be impossible)
x heal doesn't work
x win state doesn't display on all clients
