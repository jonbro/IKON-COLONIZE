CHANGELOG:
==========

- only allow 3 players in each room

1.0 JAM VERSION

- add audio
- make the homebase player recharge less powerful
- upload to kongregate
- button to exit from end of game back to the lobby screen
- button to exit pregame chat back to lobby
- game over screen
- recharge within your towers radius
- balance the towers to be beatable (should spend longer burning down the creeps, prioritize targets based on distance)
- add abilities to the players
- have an xp counter for the players
- take attack off of home base
- can't heal home base
- random number of creeps spawned
- attacking should be prioritized on distance
- make the win state actually calculate correctly
- should only heal creeps that actually need it
- creeps attack dead player (should be impossible)
- heal doesn't work
- win state doesn't display on all clients
- chat room on room screen (still should add to title screen)
- bigger webplayer
- exit and rejoin room, wrong player displayed (p1 becomes p2 if p2 didn't leave)
- display the player that is currently winning
- creeps shouldn't get hung up on the towers (remove the repulsive force from everything but the other creeps)
- display the attacks better
- have something that shows what the player is closest to
- make all of the modes direct access

TODO:
=====

- put the turtle back in
- add an action that destroys all creeps
- don't show games on the list that are in play or post game
- don't start the game immediately, require a button press
